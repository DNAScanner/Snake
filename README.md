# Snake
This is my custom batch (command prompt) script for the original, retro Snake game.

# Progress
Well, one day, I didn't have anything to do and was pretty much bored. And because I had nothing to do, I considered making a game with a bit of a challenge. So I started modifying my [SelectionMenu](https://github.com/DNAScanner/BATch-Coding/tree/main/SelectionMenu%20v2) script, which is used for the main menu. After having the main menu done, I decided to work on some sort of custom language selection system. For that I basically read out every file in the `assets\lang` folder and save the languages to variables. With this method I just had to prompt the user for their language and then I could just check, if the language was in the list of languages. I had 3 sub-projects for the current Snake project: **Snake Alpha**, which basically was the first version ever, which was made by me. **Snake Beta**, which was the last testing version, using the same, but better optimized code, with less code, but faster code. **Snake**, the current version, which is the most performant version so far, using the same code again, but even more optimized. I started working on the newest version on the *11th April 2022*, in the evening.
